"Okadaic acid (OA) is a toxin responsible for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning and is an extremely useful tool for studying processes that are regulated by phosphorylation, although the exact mechanism of action is still undetermined. We report on a study that proved the existence of OA in an unusual dimeric form when complexed with potassium ion. The proposed structure of this dimer is based on spectroscopic and conformational studies.","Daranas AH, Fernández JJ, Morales EQ, Norte M, Gavín JA.",CHEMBL_1,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1148466,10.1021/jm034189b,,10,,890fadba0eb5ef5e7f2212eaf1767faefcfb5779a04e3aa01c49d0ce74470b84,1,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry.,13,,14695814,1,Self-association of okadaic acid upon complexation with potassium ion.,47,2004
"A variety of novel heterocyclic compounds having thienoazepine, pyrroloazepine, furoazepine, and thienodiazepine skeletons were synthesized, most of which exhibited potent antagonism of [(3)H]-AVP specific binding in assays using rat liver (V1), rat kidney (V2), human platelet plasma membranes, and recombinant human CHO cells (V2), as well as antagonizing AVP-induced hypertension in rats (V1, intravenous) and showing a diuretic effect in rats (V2, oral). By detailed studies of the structure-activity relationships of these compounds, the thienoazepine derivative 1 was found to be a very potent combined V1 and V2 antagonist. After further pharmacological and toxicological evaluation as well as physical properties, the hydrochloride 2 (JTV-605) of compound 1 was selected for clinical studies as a potent AVP antagonist with a long duration of action.","Cho H, Murakami K, Nakanishi H, Fujisawa A, Isoshima H, Niwa M, Hayakawa K, Hase Y, Uchida I, Watanabe H, Wakitani K, Aisaka K.",CHEMBL_1,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1139452,10.1021/jm030287l,,101,,922aadc2b1537592ca405ca5249901dbebb4bf8f9be91e7b77ac3638b39d959d,1,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry.,109,,14695824,1,"Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-thieno[3,2-b]azepine derivatives: novel arginine vasopressin antagonists.",47,2004
"The hemoglobin-degrading aspartic proteases plasmepsin I (Plm I) and plasmepsin II (Plm II) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have lately emerged as putative drug targets. A series of C(2)-symmetric compounds encompassing the 1,2-dihydroxyethylene scaffold and a variety of elongated P1/P1' side chains were synthesized via microwave-assisted palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. Binding affinity calculations with the linear interaction energy method and molecular dynamics simulations reproduced the experimental binding data obtained in a Plm II assay with very good accuracy. Bioactive conformations of the elongated P1/P1' chains were predicted and agreed essentially with a recent X-ray structure. The compounds exhibited picomolar to nanomolar inhibition constants for the plasmepsins and no measurable affinity to the human enzyme cathepsin D. Some of the compounds also demonstrated significant inhibition of parasite growth in cell culture. To the best of our knowledge, these plasmepsin inhibitors represent the most selective reported to date and constitute promising lead compounds for further optimization.","Ersmark K, Feierberg I, Bjelic S, Hamelink E, Hackett F, Blackman MJ, Hultén J, Samuelsson B, Aqvist J, Hallberg A.",CHEMBL_1,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1139453,10.1021/jm030933g,,110,,199f29045e5b10f98a2130bdc0f0df91819b968f7880a1f6798e66f97f665cfd,1,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry.,122,,14695825,1,Potent inhibitors of the Plasmodium falciparum enzymes plasmepsin I and II devoid of cathepsin D inhibitory activity.,47,2004
"A comparative NMR conformational analysis of three distinct tetrapeptide inhibitors of the Hepatitis C NS3 protease that differ at the 4-aryloxy-substituted P2 proline position was undertaken. Specifically, transferred nuclear Overhauser effect experiments in combination with restrained systematic conformational searches were used to characterize the orientation of the P2 aryl substituents of these inhibitors when bound to the NS3 protease. Differences between free and bound conformations were also investigated. Analysis of the results allowed the design of a new P2 aromatic substituent, which significantly increased the potency of our inhibitors. The bound conformation of a specific competitive inhibitor having this novel P2 substituent is also described, along with a model of this inhibitor bound to the NS3 protease. This NS3 protease/inhibitor complex model also supports a hypothetical stabilization role for the P2 residue of the substrates and/or inhibitors and further elucidates the subtle details of the binding of the P2 residue of substrate-based inhibitors.","Goudreau N, Cameron DR, Bonneau P, Gorys V, Plouffe C, Poirier M, Lamarre D, Llinas-Brunet M.",CHEMBL_1,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1139454,10.1021/jm0303002,,123,,50cedea848b9fb48250eb1582cfe022748bfc10b171a4332486e28ca6d6427f3,1,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry.,132,,14695826,1,NMR structural characterization of peptide inhibitors bound to the Hepatitis C virus NS3 protease: design of a new P2 substituent.,47,2004
"Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) designed for immunotherapy have a high potential for avoiding the complications that may result from human immune system responses to the introduction of nonhuman mAbs into patients. This study presents a characterization of cocaine/antibody interactions that determine the binding properties of the novel human sequence mAb 2E2 using three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) methodology. We have experimentally determined the binding affinities of mAb 2E2 for cocaine and 38 cocaine analogues. The K(d) of mAb 2E2 for cocaine was 4 nM, indicating a high affinity. Also, mAb 2E2 displayed good cocaine specificity, as reflected in its 10-, 1500-, and 25000-fold lower binding affinities for the three physiologically relevant cocaine metabolites benzoylecgonine, ecgonine methyl ester, and ecgonine, respectively. 3D-QSAR models of cocaine binding were developed by comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA). A model of high statistical quality was generated showing that cocaine binds to mAb 2E2 in a sterically restricted binding site that leaves the methyl group attached to the ring nitrogen of cocaine solvent-exposed. The methyl ester group of cocaine appears to engage in attractive van der Waals interactions with mAb 2E2, whereas the phenyl group contributes to the binding primarily via hydrophobic interactions. The model further indicated that an increase in partial positive charge near the nitrogen proton and methyl ester carbonyl group enhances binding affinity and that the ester oxygen likely forms an intermolecular hydrogen bond with mAb 2E2. Overall, the cocaine binding properties of mAb 2E2 support its clinical potential for development as a treatment of cocaine overdose and addiction.","Paula S, Tabet MR, Farr CD, Norman AB, Ball WJ.",CHEMBL_1,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1139455,10.1021/jm030351z,,133,,9e8091b89e6c6652f17eab43501395e95a65c6c825b322870eae5dfee195299d,1,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry.,142,,14695827,1,Three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling of cocaine binding by a novel human monoclonal antibody.,47,2004
"alpha,gamma-Diketo acids (DKA) were discovered from screening as selective and reversible inhibitors of hepatitis C virus NS5b RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The diketo acid moiety proved essential for activity, while substitution on the gamma position was necessary for selectivity and potency. Optimization led to the identification of a DKA inhibitor of NS5b polymerase with IC(50) = 45 nM, one of the most potent HCV NS5b polymerase inhibitors reported.","Summa V, Petrocchi A, Pace P, Matassa VG, De Francesco R, Altamura S, Tomei L, Koch U, Neuner P.",CHEMBL_1,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1139456,10.1021/jm0342109,,14,,b3f23bfb8262d4f2bc8dc646431e4759c503b2dff28d01d9faa0d5604737dc97,1,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry.,17,,14695815,1,"Discovery of alpha,gamma-diketo acids as potent selective and reversible inhibitors of hepatitis C virus NS5b RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",47,2004
"Recently we reported the pharmacological characterization of the 9,10-dihydropyrrolo[1,3]benzothiazepine derivative (S)-(+)-8 as a novel atypical antipsychotic agent. This compound had an optimum pK(i) 5-HT(2A)/D(2) ratio of 1.21 (pK(i) 5-HT(2A) = 8.83; pK(i) D(2) = 7.79). The lower D(2) receptor affinity of (S)-(+)-8 compared to its enantiomer was explained by the difficulty in reaching the conformation required to optimally fulfill the D(2) pharmacophore. With the aim of finding novel atypical antipsychotics we further investigated the core structure of (S)-(+)-8, synthesizing analogues with specific substituents; the structure-activity relationship (SAR) study was also expanded with the design and synthesis of other analogues characterized by a pyrrolo[2,1-b][1,3]benzothiazepine skeleton, substituted on the benzo-fused ring or on the pyrrole system. On the 9,10-dihydro analogues the substituents introduced on the pyrrole ring were detrimental to affinity for dopamine and for 5-HT(2A) receptors, but the introduction of a double bond at C-9/10 on the structure of (S)-(+)-8 led to a potent D(2)/5-HT(2A) receptor ligand with a typical binding profile (9f, pK(i) 5-HT(2A)/D(2) ratio of 1.01, log Y = 8.43). Then, to reduce D(2) receptor affinity and restore atypicality on unsaturated analogues, we exploited the effect of specific substitutions on the tricyclic system of 9f. Through a molecular modeling approach we generated a novel series of potential atypical antipsychotic agents, with optimized 5HT(2A)/D(2) receptor affinity ratios and that were easier to synthesize and purify than the reference compound (S)-(+)-8. A number of SAR trends were identified, and among the analogues synthesized and tested in binding assays, 9d and 9m were identified as the most interesting, giving atypical log Y scores respectively 4.98 and 3.18 (pK(i) 5-HT(2A)/D(2) ratios of 1.20 and 1.30, respectively). They had a multireceptor affinity profile and could be promising atypical agents. Compound 9d, whose synthesis is easier and whose binding profile is atypical (log Y score similar to that of olanzapine, 3.89), was selected for further biological investigation. Pharmacological and biochemical studies confirmed an atypical antipsychotic profile in vivo. The compound was active on conditioned avoidance response at 1.1 mg/kg, a dose 100-times lower than that required to cause catalepsy (ED(50) >90 mg/kg), it induced a negligible increase of prolactin serum levels after single and multiple doses, and antagonized the cognitive impairment induced by phencyclidine. In conclusion, the pharmacological profile of 9d proved better than clozapine and olanzapine, making this compound a potential clinical candidate.","Campiani G, Butini S, Fattorusso C, Catalanotti B, Gemma S, Nacci V, Morelli E, Cagnotto A, Mereghetti I, Mennini T, Carli M, Minetti P, Di Cesare MA, Mastroianni D, Scafetta N, Galletti B, Stasi MA, Castorina M, Pacifici L, Vertechy M, Di Serio S, Ghirardi O, Tinti O, Carminati P.",CHEMBL_1,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1139457,10.1021/jm0309811,,143,,dec2288ece2d22fe1d79a7f77990941dd1809831bb5e451767503813c16ec7dc,1,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry.,157,,14695828,1,"Pyrrolo[1,3]benzothiazepine-based serotonin and dopamine receptor antagonists.

"The Boehringer Ingelheim compound collection was screened for inhibitors of the ATPase activity of human papillomavirus E1 helicase to develop antiviral agents that inhibit human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA replication. This screen led to the discovery of (biphenyl-4-sulfonyl)acetic acid 1, which inhibits the ATPase activity of HPV type 6 E1 helicase with a low micromolar IC(50) value. A hit-to-lead exercise rapidly converted 1 into a low nanomolar lead series.","Faucher AM, White PW, Brochu C, Grand-Maître C, Rancourt J, Fazal G.",CHEMBL_1,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1139458,10.1021/jm034206x,,18,,20a2c819723a94ea233e8aa38bb1fb3586c850dae195a5bae57fd5d43405116b,1,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry.,21,,14695816,1,Discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of the ATPase activity of human papillomavirus E1 helicase.,47,2004
