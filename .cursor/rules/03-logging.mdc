# Logging Rules

## Mandatory

- Use `UnifiedLogger` only; no `print()` or stdlib `logging` in production code.
- Set run context at process/pipeline start; mandatory fields auto-injected (run_id, pipeline, stage, timestamp_utc).
- Redact secrets and sensitive identifiers.

## Levels

DEBUG, INFO (default), WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL; include counts, durations, IDs.

## Example

```python
log.info("Extraction completed", source="chembl", rows=len(df), duration_ms=elapsed)
```

## Reference

See `docs/02-pipelines/02-logging-and-configuration.md` for detailed documentation.
