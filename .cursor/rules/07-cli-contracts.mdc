# CLI Contracts

## Interface

- Typer-based commands; prefer named options over ambiguous positionals.
- Validate inputs (paths exist, dirs writable) before execution.
- Standard exit codes: 0 success; 1 general error; 2 config error; 3 external dependency.

## UX

- Helpful error messages with remediation; progress indication for long tasks.

## Reference

See `docs/cli/00-cli-overview.md` for detailed documentation.
