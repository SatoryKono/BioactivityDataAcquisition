"(+/-)-cis-n-[1-(2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)-3-methyl-4-piperidyl]-n- phenylpropanamide (1) is a mixture of four stereoisomers [(2s,3r,4s)-1a, (2r,3r,4s)-1b, (2r,3s,4r)-1c, and (2s,3s,4r)-1d], which together constitute two diastereoisomeric pairs of optical isomers. these four stereoisomers were prepared from optically active intermediates of known absolute configuration by procedures which had no effect on the configurations of the piperidine 3- and 4-carbons. the configuration of the phenylethyl 2-carbon in the final products was determined by x-ray analysis of (2s,3s,4r)-1d. a 1h nmr comparison of the final products to ohmefentanyl established that the racemic pair previously known as ohmefentanyl was a mixture of (2s,3r,4s)-1a and (2r,3s,4r)-1c. the individual activities of 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d were evaluated in a variety of binding and pharmacological assays. the binding data revealed that isomers 1b and 1c had the highest affinity and selectivity for the mu site labeled with [3h]damgo. in contrast, the four isomers displaced [3h]etorphine in the order 1a approximately 1b > 1c approximately 1d. evaluation of the four isomers on the mouse vas deferens (mvd) preparation revealed a potency order of 1a > 1b > 1c > 1d with concentrations of 1a and 1b in the femtomolar range causing inhibition. experiments using the antagonists naltrexone (mu), ici 174864 (delta), and norbinaltorphimine (kappa) demonstrated that the effects of 1a were mediated largely by the mu receptor while both delta and kappa agonist effects contributed to the actions of 1b and 1c. isomer 1d acted as a weak mu antagonist in the mvd preparation. the same potency order was observed in a mouse analgesic assay and a rhesus monkey single dose suppression study. from the latter study the potency of 1a was estimated to be 20,000-50,000 times that of morphine, making this isomer one of the most potent opiates known. in the rhesus monkey study, isomer 1d failed to substitute for morphine and seemed to exacerbate withdrawal at doses of 0.6, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg. on the basis of the mouse data, isomer 1a was 21,000 times more potent than 1d, whereas isomers 1b and 1c were similar in their opiate activity in vivo. using the optical isomers of cis-3-methylfentanyl as reference compounds, we analyzed the effects on the pharmacological activities of introducing a phenylethyl 2-hydroxyl group into the molecule.(abstract truncated at 400 words)","brine ga, stark pa, liu y, carroll fi, singh p, xu h, rothman rb.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1128312,10.1021/jm00009a015,,1547,0f9570bf44367d4da0bb7e8aa7c85316f137fca6fc4a2d623f6b7a5a1a461b9e,6c4857c71103220576451e0ccc34f29f2616dc894c55553c21db86d89e84b79f,9,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,1557,,7739013,,1.0,"enantiomers of diastereomeric cis-n-[1-(2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)- 3-methyl-4-piperidyl]-n-phenylpropanamides: synthesis, x-ray analysis, and biological activities.",38,1995.0

"(-)-lobeline (2r,6s,10s), an antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs), inhibits the neurochemical and behavioral effects of methamphetamine and inhibits dopamine transporter (dat) and vesicular monoamine transporter (vmat2) function. vmat2 is a target for the development of treatments for methamphetamine abuse. structural modification of lobeline affords the defunctionalized analogues meso-transdiene (mtd) and lobelane, which have high potency and selectivity for vmat2. to establish the structure-activity relationships within this novel class of vmat2 ligands, specific stereochemical forms of mtd, lobelane, and other structurally related analogues have been synthesized. these compounds have been evaluated for inhibition of [(3)h]nicotine ([(3)h]nic) binding (alpha4beta2 nachr), [(3)h]methyllycaconitine ([(3)h]mla) binding (alpha7 nachr), and [(3)h]dihydrotetrabenazine ([(3)h]dtbz) binding (vmat2). generally, all of these analogues had lower affinities at alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nachrs compared to lobeline, thereby increasing selectivity for vmat2. the following structural modifications resulted in only modest changes in affinity for vmat2, affording analogues that were less potent than the lead compound, lobelane: (1) altering the stereochemistry at the c-2 and c-6 positions of the piperidino ring, (2) varying unsaturation in the piperidino c-2 and c-6 substituents, (3) introducing unsaturation into the piperidine ring, (4) ring-opening or eliminating the piperidine ring, and (5) removing the piperidino n-methyl group. furthermore, incorporating a quaternary ammonium group into defunctionalized lobeline molecules in the cis-series resulted in significant loss of affinity for vmat2, whereas only a modest change in affinity was obtained in the trans-series. the most potent (k(i) = 630 nm) and vmat2-selective compound evaluated was the n-methyl-2,6-cis-bis(naphthaleneethyl)piperidine analogue (1-nap-lobelane), in which the phenyl groups of lobelane were replaced with 1-naphthyl moieties. thus, initial structure-activity relationship studies reveal that the most promising structural changes to the lobeline molecule that lead to enhancement of vmat2 affinity and selectivity are defunctionalization, affording lobelane and mtd, and replacement of the phenyl rings of lobelane with other aromatic moieties that have a pi-extended structure.","zheng g, dwoskin lp, deaciuc ag, norrholm sd, crooks pa.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1140262,10.1021/jm0501228,,5551,e84142e0deac8e667359f116e3f46cb10ab8b47e636bd564746cf426f4d1d64f,61e3b66f07e70191e7166aa3a7a070c02e58f240b6c5790c5c5a50729c78cea9,17,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,5560,,16107155,,1.0,defunctionalized lobeline analogues: structure-activity of novel ligands for the vesicular monoamine transporter.,48,2005.0

"17beta-estradiol (e2), the most potent female sex hormone, stimulates the growth of mammary tumors and endometriosis via activation of the estrogen receptor alpha (eralpha). 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-hsd1), which is responsible for the catalytic reduction of the weakly active estrogen estrone (e1) into e2, is therefore discussed as a novel drug target. recently, we have discovered a 2,5-bis(hydroxyphenyl) oxazole to be a potent inhibitor of 17beta-hsd1. in this paper, further structural optimizations were performed: 39 bis(hydroxyphenyl) azoles, thiophenes, benzenes, and aza-benzenes were synthesized and their biological properties were evaluated. the most promising compounds of this study show enhanced ic 50 values in the low nanomolar range, a high selectivity toward 17beta-hsd2, a low binding affinity to eralpha, a good metabolic stability in rat liver microsomes, and a reasonable pharmacokinetic profile after peroral application. calculation of the molecular electrostatic potentials revealed a correlation between 17beta-hsd1 inhibition and the electron density distribution.","bey e, marchais-oberwinkler s, werth r, negri m, al-soud ya, kruchten p, oster a, frotscher m, birk b, hartmann rw.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_2|creation_date:2009-11-30,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1142534,10.1021/jm8006917,,6725,ecfaad9b142ed1ce979d9bb70a72d5daa6d639119bf5b4cdab87aaeaa422c942,a98bd97afd39fc2efc84acd82b9e9772a3724d93787ab09614e40c29f7ae7c58,21,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,6739,,18855374,,1.0,"design, synthesis, biological evaluation and pharmacokinetics of bis(hydroxyphenyl) substituted azoles, thiophenes, benzenes, and aza-benzenes as potent and selective nonsteroidal inhibitors of 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17beta-hsd1).",51,2008.0
