"(+-)-(5 beta,7 alpha,8 beta)-3,4-dichloro-n-methyl-n-[3-methylene-2- oxo-8-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro[4,5]dec-7-yl]benzeneacetamide (14) and its (5 alpha,7 alpha,8 beta) diastereomer 15 have been synthesized from 1,4-cyclohexanedione monoethylene ketal (1) in 10 steps. compound 14, which we have designated smbu-1, was found to bind with moderate affinity (ki = 109 nm) and good selectivity (mu/kappa = 29) to the kappa opioid receptor, while 15 was only 1/10 as potent as a kappa ligand. preincubation of brain membranes with 14 resulted in wash-resistant inhibition of kappa-receptor binding (69 +/- 6% of control at 10(-6) m). the ketone precursor trans-n-methyl-n-[5-oxo-2-(1- pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide (12) showed a higher kappa-affinity (ki = 78 nm) and a much higher kappa-selectivity (mu/kappa = 166) than 14. compound 10, the ethylene ketal precursor of 12, exhibited a similar receptor binding profile to 14, with increased kappa-selectivity (mu/kappa = 55), while ketal 11, being a regioisomer of 10 and an oxygen isostere of the kappa-selective analgesic spiradoline (u-62,066), demonstrated the highest kappa-affinity (ki = 1.5 nm) and kappa-selectivity (mu/kappa = 468) observed in this series.","cheng cy, wu sc, hsin lw, tam sw.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1126080,10.1021/jm00090a015,,2243,12,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,2247,,1319495,,1.0,selective reversible and irreversible ligands for the kappa opioid receptor.,35,1992.0,b06417034c2b3afd2a96d097981f6ee4e005fa260bc02a3b402642d69cd7a55b,1faf0e1b9b3c1cb24eed906d2c1926ee15084df125a9aae5cfa81a9ec396390c,0,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-05T16:17:10.680398+00:00
"(+/-)-7-aminosulfonyl-3-fluoromethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (7) is one of the most potent and selective inhibitors of phenylethanolamine n-methyltransferase (pnmt) reported to date, but a blood-brain barrier (bbb) model indicates that it cannot penetrate the bbb. to increase the lipophilicity of 7 by addition of a nonpolar substituent to the sulfonamide nitrogen, a small library of (+/-)-3-fluoromethyl-7-(n-substituted aminosulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines was synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of pnmt and for affinity at the alpha2-adrenoceptor. in addition, this library probed the pnmt active site surrounding the sulfonamide nitrogen of 7. bulky substituents on the sulfonamide nitrogen are disfavored at the pnmt active site more so than at the alpha2-adrenoceptor (thus reducing selectivity). on the other hand, alkyl chains on the sulfonamide nitrogen that contain an electron dense atom, such as a fluorine, are favored in the pnmt active site and possess little alpha2-adrenoceptor affinity, thereby conferring good selectivity (>500). several members of the library (8, 14, 17, and 18) have excellent pnmt inhibitory potency and selectivity and are predicted, on the basis of their clogp value (>0.5), to penetrate the bbb to a significant extent. compounds 17 and 18 are the most potent and selective pnmt inhibitors reported to date.","romero fa, vodonick sm, criscione kr, mcleish mj, grunewald gl.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1137211,10.1021/jm0400653,,4483,18,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,4493,,15317460,,1.0,"inhibitors of phenylethanolamine n-methyltransferase that are predicted to penetrate the blood-brain barrier: design, synthesis, and evaluation of 3-fluoromethyl-7-(n-substituted aminosulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines that possess low affinity toward the alpha2-adrenoceptor.",47,2004.0,22352a94ecfa4711e1ea01b13e222a8fe861ea483cd60f12a3a8a8684460fdd0,b0082bb41b5ab3afb103ff7fd21472a6360a6160324c4d93676b4939bc15e94c,1,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-05T16:17:10.680398+00:00

"(+)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (1), also known as ly354740, is a highly potent and selective agonist for group ii metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglu receptors 2 and 3) tested in clinical trials. it has been shown to block anxiety in the fear-potentiated startle model. its relatively low bioavailability in different animal species drove the need for an effective prodrug form that would produce a therapeutic response at lower doses for the treatment of anxiety disorders. we have investigated the increase of intestinal absorption of this compound by targeting the human peptide transporter hpept1 for active transport of di- and tripeptides derived from 1. we have found that oral administration of an n dipeptide derivative of 1 (12a) in rats shows up to an 8-fold increase in drug absorption and a 300-fold increase in potency in the fear-potentiated startle model in rats when compared with the parent drug 1.","bueno ab, collado i, de dios a, domínguez c, martín ja, martín lm, martínez-grau ma, montero c, pedregal c, catlow j, coffey ds, clay mp, dantzig ah, lindstrom t, monn ja, jiang h, schoepp dd, stratford re, tabas lb, tizzano jp, wright ra, herin mf.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1145166,10.1021/jm050235r,,5305,16,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,5320,,16078848,,1.0,"dipeptides as effective prodrugs of the unnatural amino acid (+)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (ly354740), a selective group ii metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist.",48,2005.0,a37875ae5d290ae0ea005f52be2d293a90cfa1dbd4220ed785b526435738d996,1164cc78273ab02f36d1d8d676f55da1a3902683cc11cd7fa33b1ab990bff162,2,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-05T16:17:10.680398+00:00
