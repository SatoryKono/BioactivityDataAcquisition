"(-)-lobeline (2r,6s,10s), an antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs), inhibits the neurochemical and behavioral effects of methamphetamine and inhibits dopamine transporter (dat) and vesicular monoamine transporter (vmat2) function. vmat2 is a target for the development of treatments for methamphetamine abuse. structural modification of lobeline affords the defunctionalized analogues meso-transdiene (mtd) and lobelane, which have high potency and selectivity for vmat2. to establish the structure-activity relationships within this novel class of vmat2 ligands, specific stereochemical forms of mtd, lobelane, and other structurally related analogues have been synthesized. these compounds have been evaluated for inhibition of [(3)h]nicotine ([(3)h]nic) binding (alpha4beta2 nachr), [(3)h]methyllycaconitine ([(3)h]mla) binding (alpha7 nachr), and [(3)h]dihydrotetrabenazine ([(3)h]dtbz) binding (vmat2). generally, all of these analogues had lower affinities at alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nachrs compared to lobeline, thereby increasing selectivity for vmat2. the following structural modifications resulted in only modest changes in affinity for vmat2, affording analogues that were less potent than the lead compound, lobelane: (1) altering the stereochemistry at the c-2 and c-6 positions of the piperidino ring, (2) varying unsaturation in the piperidino c-2 and c-6 substituents, (3) introducing unsaturation into the piperidine ring, (4) ring-opening or eliminating the piperidine ring, and (5) removing the piperidino n-methyl group. furthermore, incorporating a quaternary ammonium group into defunctionalized lobeline molecules in the cis-series resulted in significant loss of affinity for vmat2, whereas only a modest change in affinity was obtained in the trans-series. the most potent (k(i) = 630 nm) and vmat2-selective compound evaluated was the n-methyl-2,6-cis-bis(naphthaleneethyl)piperidine analogue (1-nap-lobelane), in which the phenyl groups of lobelane were replaced with 1-naphthyl moieties. thus, initial structure-activity relationship studies reveal that the most promising structural changes to the lobeline molecule that lead to enhancement of vmat2 affinity and selectivity are defunctionalization, affording lobelane and mtd, and replacement of the phenyl rings of lobelane with other aromatic moieties that have a pi-extended structure.","zheng g, dwoskin lp, deaciuc ag, norrholm sd, crooks pa.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,ChEMBL_36,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1140262,10.1021/jm0501228,,2025-12-03T16:03:38.714071+00:00,5551,5888bc2e4943847f4d152c09dc8278cf0ee6f6f6694a48aaf416f0f70d6fff75,fbcd66965a11dda4c4e961e109fc1d06062a19e60db1d8fdc61242671ac27f41,12,17,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,5560,,16107155,,1.0,defunctionalized lobeline analogues: structure-activity of novel ligands for the vesicular monoamine transporter.,48,2005.0

"(nrh):quinone oxidoreductase 2 (nqo2) is associated with various processes involved in cancer initiation and progression probably via the production of ros during quinone metabolism. thus, there is a need to develop inhibitors of nqo2 that are active in vitro and in vivo. as part of a strategy to achieve this we have used the 4-aminoquinoline backbone as a starting point and synthesized 21 novel analogues. the syntheses utilised p-anisidine with meldrum's acid and trimethyl orthoacetate or trimethyl orthobenzoate to give the 4-hydrazin-quinoline scaffold, which was derivatised with aldehydes or acid chlorides to give hydrazone or hydrazide analogues, respectively. the hydrazones were the most potent inhibitors of nqo2 in cell free systems, some with low nano-molar ic<sub>50</sub> values. structure-activity analysis highlighted the importance of a small substituent at the 2-position of the 4-aminoquinoline ring, to reduce steric hindrance and improve engagement of the scaffold within the nqo2 active site. cytotoxicity and nqo2-inhibitory activity in vitro was evaluated using ovarian cancer skov-3 and tov-112 cells (expressing high and low levels of nqo2, respectively). generally, the hydrazones were more toxic than hydrazide analogues and further, toxicity is unrelated to cellular nqo2 activity. pharmacological inhibition of nqo2 in cells was measured using the toxicity of cb1954 as a surrogate end-point. both the hydrazone and hydrazide derivatives are functionally active as inhibitors of nqo2 in the cells, but at different inhibitory potency levels. in particular, 4-((2-(6-methoxy-2-methylquinolin-4-yl)hydrazono)methyl)phenol has the greatest potency of any compound yet evaluated (53 nm), which is 50-fold lower than its toxicity ic<sub>50</sub>. this compound and some of its analogues could serve as useful pharmacological probes to determine the functional role of nqo2 in cancer development and response to therapy.","hussein b, ikhmais b, kadirvel m, magwaza rn, halbert g, bryce ra, stratford ij, freeman s.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_28|creation_date:2021-01-15,,ChEMBL_36,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL4359921,10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111649,,2025-12-03T16:03:38.714071+00:00,111649,866e6a163d00ecd6aaa331f66a0e12d1d0c3834debb3b09585930d5fee3a0971,ca693c5e5d5e6be007fc15b7f075d59db3248530b42ed0ade9229cf7ff134127,48,,eur j med chem,european journal of medicinal chemistry.,111649,,31514018,,1.0,discovery of potent 4-aminoquinoline hydrazone inhibitors of nrh:quinoneoxidoreductase-2 (nqo2).,182,2019.0

"1,3-dioxanes 1 and cyclohexanes 2 bearing a phenyl ring and an aminoethyl moiety in 1,3-relationship to each other represent highly potent σ<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists. in order to increase the chemical stability of the acetalic 1,3-dioxanes 1 and the polarity of the cyclohexanes 2, tetrahydropyran derivatives 3 equipped with the same substituents were designed, synthesized and pharmacologically evaluated. the key step of the synthesis was a lipase-catalyzed enantioselective acetylation of the alcohol (r)-5 leading finally to enantiomerically pure test compounds 3a-g. with respect to σ<sub>1</sub> receptor affinity and selectivity over a broad range of related (σ<sub>2</sub>, pcp binding site) and further targets, the enantiomeric benzylamines 3a and cyclohexylmethylamines 3b represent the most promising drug candidates of this series. however, the eudismic ratio for σ<sub>1</sub> binding is only in the range of 2.5-3.3. classical molecular dynamics (md) simulations confirmed the same binding pose for both the tetrahydropyran 3 and cyclohexane derivatives 2 at the σ<sub>1</sub> receptor, according to which: i) the protonated amino moiety of (2s,6r)-3a engages the same key polar interactions with glu172 (ionic) and phe107 (π-cation), ii) the lipophilic parts of (2s,6r)-3a are hosted in three hydrophobic regions of the σ<sub>1</sub> receptor, and iii) the o-atom of the tetrahydropyran derivatives 3 does not show a relevant interaction with the σ<sub>1</sub> receptor. further in silico evidences obtained by the application of free energy perturbation and steered md techniques fully supported the experimentally observed difference in receptor/ligand affinities. tetrahydropyrans 3 require a lower dissociative force peak than cyclohexane analogs 2. enantiomeric benzylamines 3a and cyclohexylmethylamines 3b were able to inhibit the growth of the androgen negative human prostate cancer cell line du145. the cyclohexylmethylamine (2s,6r)-3b showed the highest σ<sub>1</sub> affinity (k<sub>i</sub>(σ<sub>1</sub>) = 0.95 nm) and the highest analgesic activity in vivo (67%).","kopp n, civenni g, marson d, laurini e, pricl s, catapano cv, humpf hu, almansa c, nieto fr, schepmann d, wünsch b.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_31|creation_date:2022-07-12,,ChEMBL_36,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL4814072,10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113443,,2025-12-03T16:03:38.714071+00:00,113443,d2e297fced87d9ac1ae77f2e1976923ab5b3bb0642ae3d5b6683d3a629b78a54,8ae53b7e6bdc9a46e0202b0b516b7ff51ef8ab2daeae3a97742916f445740265,69,,eur j med chem,european journal of medicinal chemistry.,113443,,33901806,,1.0,"chemoenzymatic synthesis of 2,6-disubstituted tetrahydropyrans with high σ<sub>1</sub> receptor affinity, antitumor and analgesic activity.",219,2021.0
