"a close analogue of the antileukemic agent 5,8-dideaza-n10 propargylfolic acid (2) was synthesized by replacing the propargyl moiety of 2 with a cyanomethyl group. this compound, n10-(cyanomethyl)-5,8-dideazafolic acid (3), was evaluated for its antifolate and antitumor activities in several biological test systems. alkylation of diethyl n-(4-aminobenzoyl)-l-glutamate with bromoacetonitrile gave diethyl n-[4-[(cyanomethyl)amino]benzoyl]-l-glutamate (7). reaction of 7 with 2 amino-6-(bromomethyl)-4-hydroxyquinazoline (9) in dimethylacetamide gave the corresponding diethyl ester 11, which was hydrolyzed to the target compound 3. the known antileukemic agent 2 was also synthesized for comparative studies by employing a modified procedure, which resulted in a better yield of this product. both compounds 2 and 3 were evaluated for their antifolate activities by using two folate-requiring microorganisms, streptococcus faecium and lactobacillus casei. they were further evaluated as inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase derived from the above organisms, as well as for their antitumor activity by using selected tumor cells in culture. compound 2 was found to be as equally potent as methotrexate (mtx) against s. faecium, and it was an excellent inhibitor of l. casei thymidylate synthase. the cyanomethyl analogue 3 was less active than 2 in all the test systems, except the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase.","nair mg, salter dc, kisliuk rl, gaumont y, north g, sirotnak fm.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1122470,10.1021/jm00358a030,,605,4,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,607,,6403710,,1.0,"folate analogues. 21. synthesis and antifolate and antitumor activities of n10-(cyanomethyl)-5,8-dideazafolic acid.",26,1983.0,04872ac6c6ed3b7a6a06524f243762f43fb126049a562ed8a04300445e431c67,9184f7580181dd30def7e4eedbd148ebd373b56c346876648fa44873c87b493a,410,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00
"a consideration of the detailed structural information available from x-ray crystallographic and nmr studies on complexes of dihydrofolate reductase with inhibitors has led to the design of trimethoprim analogues with improved binding properties. computer graphic techniques have been used to predict which substituent groups were required at the 3'-o position of brodimoprim (2,4-diamino-5-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-bromobenzyl)pyrimidine) to make additional interactions with the enzyme. nmr spectroscopy provided a convenient method of assessing if the analogues were binding in the predicted manner. on the basis of this approach, the c4,c6-dicarboxylic acid analogue ix was designed to interact with arg-57 and his-28 in the enzyme, and this analogue was found to bind 3 orders of magnitude more tightly than the parent brodimoprim.","birdsall b, feeney j, pascual c, roberts gc, kompis i, then rl, müller k, kroehn a.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1122542,10.1021/jm00378a025,,1672,12,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,1676,,6438320,,1.0,a 1h nmr study of the interactions and conformations of rationally designed brodimoprim analogues in complexes with lactobacillus casei dihydrofolate reductase.,27,1984.0,36b0b6bdea4feab356e5113d5b8b0418a18d7cf0595ce79b0fd43b94067ec243,7986c61c93c75af20f81b9b0578a4904188b5ad014de51867c74b19ab5d27369,441,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"2-phenylpyrroles were synthesized as conformationally restricted analogues of the substituted benzamide sultopride and the butyrophenones haloperidol and fluanisone. dopamine antagonistic activity is maintained if the 2-phenylpyrrole side chain is linked to the pharmacophoric n-ethylpyrrolidine moiety of sultopride or to the 4-substituted piperazine moiety of fluanisone but is lost if the 2-phenylpyrrole is combined with the 4-substituted piperidine moiety of haloperidol. the 2-phenylpyrrole analogue 1 of sultopride is in vitro 0.25 and in vivo 3 times as potent as the parent compound. its binding to the dopamine d-2 receptors is, in analogy to the substituted benzamides, strongly sodium-dependent. the 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyrrole analogue 5 of fluanisone is superior in vitro as well as in vivo to the corresponding benzamide 7 and the butyrophenone fluanisone. the increase in activity is not only due to a higher affinity for the d-2 receptors but also to an enhanced oral absorption (ratio po/ip = 4.5 vs 40 for the benzamide and 60 for fluanisone). compound 5 is further characterized by a high selectivity for the d-2 receptors, in contrast to the benzamide and butyrophenone analogues (ratio d-2/alpha 1 = 60, 2.0, and 0.3, respectively). the binding to the d-2 receptors has little dependence on sodium. the 2-phenylpyrrole 5 shares with the benzamide 7 a low potential to induce catalepsy, which is in contrast to haloperidol. so, 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-[[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]methyl]pyrrole (5) is the prototype of a new class of sodium-independent dopamine d-2 antagonists, which may be particularly useful as potential antipsychotics with a low propensity to induce acute extrapyramidal side effects.","van wijngaarden i, kruse cg, van hes r, van der heyden ja, tulp mt.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1123646,10.1021/jm00394a028,,2099,11,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,2104,,2889830,,1.0,2-phenylpyrroles as conformationally restricted benzamide analogues. a new class of potential antipsychotics. 1.,30,1987.0,f048574a6b9544a64854a4dc9297953c930a1cdc76b52a161378559a7764126a,7f0b6b7553fa040c439c2ad81242c2f434041dea244aa80d3e87df109a548b42,150,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00
"a group of trimethoprim (tmp) analogues containing 3,5-dialkyl(or halo)-4-alkoxy, -hydroxy, or -amino substitution were analyzed in terms of their inhibitory activities against four dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) isozymes. although selectivities were lower than with tmp, the activities against vertebrate dhfr were usually at least 2 orders of magnitude less than against enzymes from microbial sources. however, the profiles of activity were remarkably similar for rat, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and plasmodium berghei enzymes in all three series, although somewhat different for escherichia coli dhfr, leading to the conclusion that the hydrophobic pockets are similar for the first three isozymes. optimal substitution was reached with 3,5-di-n-propyl or 3-ethyl-5-n-propyl groups. branching of chains at the alpha-carbon, which resulted in increased substituent thickness, was detrimental to e. coli dhfr inhibition in particular. mr is an inadequate parameter for use in correlating such substituent effects. conformational changes of the more bulky inhibitors can be invoked to explain some differences in inhibitory pattern. although log p explains simple substituent effects with the vertebrate dhfrs very well, it is insufficient in the more complex cases described here, where shape is clearly involved as well. solvent-accessible surface areas were measured for tmp in e. coli and chicken dhfrs, where the coordinates are now known. the environment is more hydrophobic in the latter case; this can also be postulated for rat dhfr, which has a very similar activity profile. as with the mammalian isozymes, n. gonorrhoeae dhfr contains an active site phenylalanine replacing leu-28 of e. coli dhfr, thus creating a more hydrophobic pocket. a similar replacement may also occur in the p.berghei isozyme. selectivity for bacterial dhfr is dependent on the nature of the 4-substituent, being low for polar 4-hydroxy compounds but high for polar 4-amino analogues, possibly as a result of solvation differences. with complex substituents, the environment of each atom in the active site must be taken into account to adequately explain structure-activity relationships.","roth b, rauckman bs, ferone r, baccanari dp, champness jn, hyde rm.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1123675,10.1021/jm00385a017,,348,2,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,356,,3100802,,1.0,"2,4-diamino-5-benzylpyrimidines as antibacterial agents. 7. analysis of the effect of 3,5-dialkyl substituent size and shape on binding to four different dihydrofolate reductase enzymes.",30,1987.0,342cf7a8ec1ff493f09bfd9a728fe7a227e6a1484e7fa1cec6839ee814795c0c,257e4777d22cf7b763dbcbe8696dcc3df7ea06efc084ea1ae824d79e846ba2e4,520,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"2,4-diaminoquinazoline antifolates with a lipophilic side chain at the 5-position, and in one case with a classical (p-aminobenzoyl)-l-glutamate side chain, were synthesized as potentially selective inhibitors of a site-directed mutant of human dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) containing phenylalanine instead of leucine at position 22. this mutant enzyme is approximately 100-fold more resistant than native enzyme to the classical antifolate methotrexate (mtx), yet shows minimal cross resistance to the nonclassical antifolates piritrexim (ptx) and trimetrexate (tmq). although they were much less potent than trimetrexate and piritrexim, the lipophilic 5-substituted analogues were all found to bind approximately 10 times better to the mutant dhfr than to the wild-type enzyme. the potency of the analogue with a classical (p-aminobenzoyl)-l-glutamate side chain was similarly diminished in comparison with mtx, but the difference in its binding affinity to the two dhfr species was only 5-fold. thus, by making subtle structural changes in the antifolate molecule, it may be possible to attack resistance due to mutational alterations in the active site of the target enzyme. also, to test the hypothesis that dhfr from pneumocystis carinii and toxoplasma gondii may have a less sterically restrictive active site than the enzyme from mammalian cells, inhibition assays using several of the lipophilic analogues in the series were carried out against the p. carinii and t. gondii reductases in comparison with the enzyme from rat liver. in contrast to their preferential binding to mutant versus wild-type human dhfr, binding of these analogues to the p. carinii and t. gondii enzymes was weaker than binding to rat enzyme. it thus appears that, if the active site of the dhfr from these parasites is less sterically restrictive than the active site of the mammalian enzyme, this difference cannot be successfully exploited by moving the side chain from the 6-position to the 5-position.","rosowsky a, mota ce, queener sf, waltham m, ercikan-abali e, bertino jr.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1128249,10.1021/jm00005a002,,745,5,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,752,,7877140,,1.0,"2,4-diamino-5-substituted-quinazolines as inhibitors of a human dihydrofolate reductase with a site-directed mutation at position 22 and of the dihydrofolate reductases from pneumocystis carinii and toxoplasma gondii.",38,1995.0,15d38ef7ff3289d3ce90b2fc5f0f0a06c4316d036e2b082a3728fac41c2c373a,ad00dc5661bd11d95ef3cc7d21cf5a9f10707cf86cda434ea42833fbaab91524,121,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00
"(+/-)-cis-n-[1-(2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)-3-methyl-4-piperidyl]-n- phenylpropanamide (1) is a mixture of four stereoisomers [(2s,3r,4s)-1a, (2r,3r,4s)-1b, (2r,3s,4r)-1c, and (2s,3s,4r)-1d], which together constitute two diastereoisomeric pairs of optical isomers. these four stereoisomers were prepared from optically active intermediates of known absolute configuration by procedures which had no effect on the configurations of the piperidine 3- and 4-carbons. the configuration of the phenylethyl 2-carbon in the final products was determined by x-ray analysis of (2s,3s,4r)-1d. a 1h nmr comparison of the final products to ohmefentanyl established that the racemic pair previously known as ohmefentanyl was a mixture of (2s,3r,4s)-1a and (2r,3s,4r)-1c. the individual activities of 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d were evaluated in a variety of binding and pharmacological assays. the binding data revealed that isomers 1b and 1c had the highest affinity and selectivity for the mu site labeled with [3h]damgo. in contrast, the four isomers displaced [3h]etorphine in the order 1a approximately 1b > 1c approximately 1d. evaluation of the four isomers on the mouse vas deferens (mvd) preparation revealed a potency order of 1a > 1b > 1c > 1d with concentrations of 1a and 1b in the femtomolar range causing inhibition. experiments using the antagonists naltrexone (mu), ici 174864 (delta), and norbinaltorphimine (kappa) demonstrated that the effects of 1a were mediated largely by the mu receptor while both delta and kappa agonist effects contributed to the actions of 1b and 1c. isomer 1d acted as a weak mu antagonist in the mvd preparation. the same potency order was observed in a mouse analgesic assay and a rhesus monkey single dose suppression study. from the latter study the potency of 1a was estimated to be 20,000-50,000 times that of morphine, making this isomer one of the most potent opiates known. in the rhesus monkey study, isomer 1d failed to substitute for morphine and seemed to exacerbate withdrawal at doses of 0.6, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg. on the basis of the mouse data, isomer 1a was 21,000 times more potent than 1d, whereas isomers 1b and 1c were similar in their opiate activity in vivo. using the optical isomers of cis-3-methylfentanyl as reference compounds, we analyzed the effects on the pharmacological activities of introducing a phenylethyl 2-hydroxyl group into the molecule.(abstract truncated at 400 words)","brine ga, stark pa, liu y, carroll fi, singh p, xu h, rothman rb.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1128312,10.1021/jm00009a015,,1547,9,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,1557,,7739013,,1.0,"enantiomers of diastereomeric cis-n-[1-(2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl)- 3-methyl-4-piperidyl]-n-phenylpropanamides: synthesis, x-ray analysis, and biological activities.",38,1995.0,b5945cd568dc41c457aa8e94b7b7309016f1b073ba88c3d97ec7c05fe57bfd27,2129c254278eb9273eea5877ac4d77a83ce5faa9c65cf52c176783da4d71e475,11,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00
"a new pharmacophoric model for the h1-antagonist binding site is derived which reveals that a simple atom to atom matching of compounds is not sufficient; in this model, interacting residues from the receptor need to be included. to obtain this model, the bioactive conformations of several (semi-)rigid classical histamine h1-receptor antagonists have been investigated (cyproheptadine, phenindamine, triprolidine, epinastine, mequitazine, ibf28145, and mianserine). in general, these antihistamines contain two aromatic rings and a basic nitrogen atom. a previously derived pharmacophoric model with the nitrogen position fixed relative to the two aromatic rings is now found not to be suitable for describing the h1-antagonist binding site. a procedure is described which allows for significant freedom in the position of the basic nitrogen of the histamine h1-antagonist. the area accessible to the basic nitrogen is confined to the region accessible to its counterion on the histamine h1-receptor, i.e., the carboxylate group of asp116. the basic nitrogen is assumed to form an ionic hydrogen bond with this aspartic acid which c alpha- and c beta-carbons are fixed with respect to the protein backbone. via this hydrogen bond, the direction of the acidic proton of the antagonist is taken into account. within these computational procedures, an aspartic acid is coupled to the basic nitrogen of each h1-antagonist considered; the carboxylate group is connected to the positively charged nitrogen via geometric h-bonding restraints obtained from a thorough database search (csd). also to the basic nitrogen of the pharmacophore is coupled an aspartic acid (to yield our new template). in order to derive a model for the h1-antagonist binding site, the aromatic ring systems of the antagonists and template are matched according to a previously described procedure. subsequently, the c alpha- and c beta-carbons of the aspartic acid coupled to the h1-antagonists are matched with those of the template in a procedure which allows the antagonist and the carboxylate group to adapt their conformation (and also their relative position) in order to optimize the overlap with the template. a six-point pharmacophoric model is derived which has stereoselective features and is furthermore able to distinguish between the so-called ""cis""- and ""trans""-rings mentioned in many (q)sar studies on h1-antagonists. due to its stereoselectivity, the model is able to designate the absolute bioactive configuration of antihistamines such as phenindamine (s), epinastine (s), and ibf28145 (r). a further merit of this study is that a model is obtained which includes an amino acid from the receptor.(abstract truncated at 400 words)","ter laak am, venhorst j, donné-op den kelder gm, timmerman h.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1128524,10.1021/jm00017a019,,3351,17,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,3360,,7650688,,1.0,the histamine h1-receptor antagonist binding site. a stereoselective pharmacophoric model based upon (semi-)rigid h1-antagonists and including a known interaction site on the receptor.,38,1995.0,dae9a7012f37ed12ed2660e0791c08edf3fda1954c3664a79dda85aad655de7e,501677c4b60e082eb417dbae29715fde8855bdecd665fa868dc5393c4fd4078c,772,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"a new route to n-1-substituted pyrazolo- and pyrroloquinazolines has been developed from the known quinazolones 19 and 23, via conversion to the corresponding thiones, s-methylation to the thioethers, n-1-alkylation, and coupling with 3-bromoaniline. c-3-substituted pyrroloquinazolines were prepared by mannich base chemistry. a series of compounds bearing solubilizing side chains at these positions has been prepared and evaluated for inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the isolated epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and of its autophosphorylation in egf-stimulated a431 cells. several analogues, particularly c-3-substituted pyrroloquinazolines, retained high potency in both assays. a model for the binding of the general class of 4-anilinoquinazolines to the egfr was constructed from structural information (particularly for the catalytic subunit of the camp-dependent protein kinase) and structure-activity relationships (sar) in the series. in this model, the pyrrole ring in pyrroloquinazolines (and the 6- and 7-positions of quinazoline and related pyridopyrimidine inhibitors) occupies the entrance of the atp binding pocket of the enzyme, with the pyrrole nitrogen located at the bottom of the cleft and the pyrrole c-3 position pointing toward a pocket corresponding to the ribose binding site of atp. this allows considerable bulk tolerance for c-3 substituents and lesser but still significant bulk tolerance for n-1 substituents. the observed high selectivity of these compounds for binding to egfr over other similar tyrosine kinases is attributed to the 4-anilino ring binding in an adjacent hydrophobic pocket which has an amino acid composition unique to the egfr. the sar seen for inhibition of the isolated enzyme by the pyrazolo- and pyrroloquinazolines discussed here is fully consistent with this binding model. for the n-1-substituted compounds, inhibition of autophosphorylation in a431 cells correlates well with inhibition of the isolated enzyme, as seen previously for related pyridopyrimidines. however, the c-3-substituted pyrroloquinazolines show unexpectedly high potencies in the autophosphorylation assay, making them of particular interest.","palmer bd, trumpp-kallmeyer s, fry dw, nelson jm, showalter hd, denny wa.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1130030,10.1021/jm960789h,,1519,10,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,1529,,9154973,,1.0,"tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 11. soluble analogues of pyrrolo- and pyrazoloquinazolines as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors: synthesis, biological evaluation, and modeling of the mode of binding.",40,1997.0,ef3ed50df4b4e972c252797aea298bb13eca9480498deb6ab30dfa58721dc661,543346313fadbd5b6bdeb52f4589589def1b593b40a51c34ec851dbc8f11e9ff,773,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"3-phenylpiperidines (ppes) have been thoroughly investigated in view of their interesting dopaminergic activity, and the n-n-propyl substitution has been suggested as the most effective among several ppes differently substituted on the phenyl ring. in previous studies, we found that the dimethyl substitution on the phenyl ring of n-unsubstituted ppes provided compounds active toward alpha2-adrenergic receptors (alpha2-ars), which proved to possess interesting selectivity properties. the high degree of homology between the binding domains of alpha2-ars and d4-dopaminergic receptors (d4-dars) prompted us to verify whether this kind of substitution on the aromatic ring might prove to be active against retinal dars of the d4 subtype. on the basis of these premises, we synthesized the dimethylphenyl-substituted ppes 4a-f, in which an n-propyl chain is present on the aminic nitrogen. radioligand binding assays on bovine retina and striatum membranes for d1-like and d2-like dars indicated that ppes 4a, 4b, and 4f possess a high affinity and selectivity for the d4-dar subtype of bovine retina.","cervetto l, demontis gc, giannaccini g, longoni b, macchia b, macchia m, martinelli a, orlandini e.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1131416,10.1021/jm9708700,,4933,25,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,4938,,9836610,,1.0,n-n-propyl-substituted 3-(dimethylphenyl)piperidines display novel discriminative properties between dopamine receptor subtypes: synthesis and receptor binding studies.,41,1998.0,f1c1644cfccbd2fb2c5c254df0be8dc76e3dc10b1223454e0d86b5004539c1b9,4812da8e953610872d7d5fd8cb8741901ef0dbc63dc294b2e9ae0b2fd1d5de45,210,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00
"a comparative binding energy (combine) analysis (ortiz et al. j. med. chem. 1995, 38, 2681-2691) has been performed on a training set of 33 hiv-1 protease inhibitors, and the resulting regression models have been validated using an additional external set of 16 inhibitors. this data set was originally reported by holloway et al. (j. med. chem. 1995, 38, 305-317), who showed the usefulness of molecular mechanics interaction energies for predicting the activity of novel hiv-1 protease inhibitors within the framework of the mm2x force field and linear regression techniques. we first used the amber force field on the same set of three-dimensional structures to check up on any possible force-field dependencies. in agreement with the previous findings, the calculated raw ligand-receptor interaction energies were highly correlated with the inhibitory activities (r2 = 0.81), and the linear regression model relating both magnitudes had an acceptable predictive ability both in internal validation tests (q2 = 0.79, sdepcv = 0.61) and when applied to the external set of 16 different inhibitors (sdepex = 1.08). when the interaction energies were further analyzed using the combine formalism, the resulting pls model showed improved fitting properties (r2 = 0.89) and provided better estimations for the activity of the compounds in the external data set (sdepex = 0.83). computation of the electrostatic part of the ligand-receptor interactions by numerically solving the poisson-boltzmann equation did not improve the quality of the linear regression model. on the contrary, incorporation of the solvent-screened residue-based electrostatic interactions and two additional descriptors representing the electrostatic energy contributions to the partial desolvation of both the ligands and the receptor resulted in a combine model that achieved a remarkable predictive ability, as assessed by both internal (q2 = 0.73, sdepcv = 0.69) and external validation tests (sdepex = 0.59). finally, when all the inhibitors studied were merged into a single expanded set, a new model was obtained that explained 91% of the variance in biological activity (r2 = 0.91), with very high predictive ability (q2 = 0.81, sdepcv = 0.66). in addition, the combine analysis provided valuable information about the relative importance of the contributions to the activity of individual residues that can be fruitfully used to design better inhibitors. all in all, combine analysis is validated as a powerful methodology for predicting binding affinities and pharmacological activities of congeneric ligands that bind to a common receptor.","pérez c, pastor m, ortiz ar, gago f.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1131491,10.1021/jm970535b,,836,6,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,852,,9526559,,1.0,comparative binding energy analysis of hiv-1 protease inhibitors: incorporation of solvent effects and validation as a powerful tool in receptor-based drug design.,41,1998.0,62cd50d811159a9800c275e5b339a51d99c9313afd507aef7c20a1ef2595a6f9,039b3c2f776d4443ee886b84b9556aacc453b62c7474692aa4279656eb2e9ac4,420,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl]carbazole (rimcazole) has been characterized as a sigma receptor antagonist that binds to the dopamine transporter with moderate affinity (k(i) = 224 nm). although the binding affinities at the dopamine transporter of rimcazole and cocaine are comparable, rimcazole only depressed locomotor activity in mice and antagonized the stimulant effects produced by cocaine. the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the attenuation of cocaine's effects are not understood, although interaction at a low affinity site/state of the dopamine transporter has been suggested. to explore further this class of compounds, a series of rimcazole analogues was designed and synthesized. displacement of [(3)h]win 35,428 binding at the dopamine transporter in rat caudate-putamen revealed that aromatic substitutions on rimcazole were not well tolerated, generally, with significant reductions in affinity for the 3,6-dibromo (5; k(i) = 3890 nm), 1,3, 6-tribromo (6; k(i) = 30300 nm), 3-amino (8; k(i) = 2400 nm), and 3, 6-dinitro (9; k(i) = 174000 nm) analogues. the n-phenylpropyl group was the only terminal piperazine nitrogen substituent that retained moderate affinity at the dopamine transporter (11; k(i) = 263 nm). analogues in which the carbazole ring was replaced with a freely rotating diphenylamine moiety were also prepared. although the diphenylamino analogue in which the terminal piperazine nitrogen was unsubstituted, as in rimcazole, demonstrated relatively low binding affinity at the dopamine transporter (24; k(i) = 813 nm), the n-phenylpropyl analogue was found to have the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter within the series (25; k(i) = 61.0 nm). all of the analogues that had affinity for the dopamine transporter inhibited [(3)h]dopamine uptake in synaptosomes, and potencies for these two effects showed a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.7731, p = 0.0018). several of the analogues displaced [(3)h]paroxetine from serotonin transporters with moderate to high affinity, with the n-phenylpropyl derivative (11) having the highest affinity (k(i) = 44.5 nm). in contrast, none of the analogues recognized the norepinephrine transporter with an affinity of <1.3 microm. binding affinities for sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors were also determined, and several of the compounds were more potent than rimcazole with affinities ranging from 97 nm to >6 microm at sigma(1) sites and 145 to 1990 nm at sigma(2) sites. the compound with the highest affinity (25) at sigma(1) sites was also the compound with highest affinity at the dopamine transporter. these novel rimcazole analogues may provide important tools with which to characterize the relationship between the low affinity site or state of the dopamine transporter, sigma receptors, and their potential roles in modulating cocaine's psychostimulant actions.","husbands sm, izenwasser s, kopajtic t, bowen wd, vilner bj, katz jl, newman ah.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1132454,10.1021/jm9902943,,4446,21,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,4455,,10543888,,1.0,"structure-activity relationships at the monoamine transporters and sigma receptors for a novel series of 9-[3-(cis-3, 5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl]carbazole (rimcazole) analogues.",42,1999.0,d1d8a1bd5a60fc651f860ab502080a9fa0a3786d7a9f2b8f57b57978de46fe21,8a53ae0c823d394c868df18851bc29bc0b88ab3190830f4b4d1f2a95872d5ef7,340,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"4-anilinoquinazoline- and 4-anilinopyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine-6-acrylamides are potent pan-erbb tyrosine kinase inactivators, and one example (ci-1033) is in clinical trial. a series of analogues with a variety of michael acceptor units at the 6-position were prepared to define the structural requirements for irreversible inhibition. a particular goal was to determine whether additional functions to increase solubility could be appended to the michael acceptor. substituted acrylamides were prepared by direct acylation of the corresponding 6-amines with the requisite acid or acid chloride. vinylsulfonamide derivatives were obtained by acylation of the amines with chloroethylsulfonyl chloride followed by base-promoted elimination. vinylsulfone and vinylsulfine derivatives were prepared by oxidation and base elimination of a hydroxyethylthio intermediate. the compounds were evaluated for their inhibition of phosphorylation of the isolated egfr enzyme and for inhibition of egf-stimulated autophosphorylation of egfr in a431 cells and of heregulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of erbb2 in mda-mb 453 cells. substitution at the nitrogen of the acrylamide was tolerated only with a methyl group; larger substituents were dystherapeutic, and no substitution at all was tolerated at the acrylamide alpha-carbon. in contrast, while electron-donating groups at the acrylamide beta-carbon were not useful, even quite large electron-withdrawing groups (which increase its electrophilicity) were tolerated. a series of derivatives with solubility-enhancing substituents linked to the acrylamide beta-carbon via amides were potent irreversible inhibitors of isolated egfr (ic50s = 0.4-1.1 nm), with weakly basic morpholine and imidazole derivatives being the best. vinylsulfonamides were also potent and irreversible inhibitors, but vinylsulfones and vinylsulfines were reversible and only poorly active. two compounds were evaluated against a431, h125, and mcf-7 xenografts in nude mice but were inferior in these assays to the clinical trial compound ci-1033.","smaill jb, showalter hd, zhou h, bridges aj, mcnamara dj, fry dw, nelson jm, sherwood v, vincent pw, roberts bj, elliott wl, denny wa.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1134843,10.1021/jm000372i,,429,3,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,440,,11462982,,1.0,"tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 18. 6-substituted 4-anilinoquinazolines and 4-anilinopyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidines as soluble, irreversible inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor.",44,2001.0,475c280dec0a000747de0a9f1b9dff9d647315426650a7f7a5f1307eccaa1683,2a1d01080e6d999148dee074b6bedfaba39880bad762a505fdac09ced9b88cb8,231,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"4-nitrobenzylthioinosine (nbti, 1) is a well-known inhibitor for the nucleoside transport protein ent1. however, its highly polar nature is unfavorable for oral absorption and/or penetration into the cns. in the search for compounds with lower polarity than nbti we replaced its ribose moiety by substituted benzyl groups. halogen, hydroxyl, (trifluoro)methyl(-oxy), nitro, and amine functionalities were among the substituents at the benzyl group. in general, substitution of the benzyl group resulted in a lower affinity for ent1. only 2-hydroxyl substitution showed a higher affinity. most likely this is the result of hydrogen bonding. substitution at the 2-position of the benzyl group with aryl groups was also addressed. compared to parent compound carrying a 2-phenylbenzyl group, all synthesized analogues gave higher affinities. introduction of fluoro, trifluoromethyl, methoxy, and hydroxyl groups at the phenyl group clearly showed that addition to the 4-position was preferable. despite the highly different character of a ribose and a benzyl group, ki values in the low nanomolar range were obtained for the benzyl-substituted derivatives. compound 35, luf5919, and compound 60, luf5929, displayed the highest affinity (ki = 39 nm for both compounds), having a polar surface area of 101 a2 and 85 a2, respectively.","tromp ra, van ameijde s, pütz c, sundermann c, sundermann b, von frijtag drabbe künzel jk, ijzerman ap.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1138795,10.1021/jm049735v,,5441,22,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,5450,,15481982,,1.0,inhibition of nucleoside transport by new analogues of 4-nitrobenzylthioinosine: replacement of the ribose moiety by substituted benzyl groups.,47,2004.0,97f55a20db74c53161ed6e32aa9536ec25109900ff34c8695f996c08f8b8dcb8,c7ac35f0515ecf17be7ad1ad323ff6e812dfdd97d5879b78bddfe2177ddccd13,241,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"(-)-lobeline (2r,6s,10s), an antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs), inhibits the neurochemical and behavioral effects of methamphetamine and inhibits dopamine transporter (dat) and vesicular monoamine transporter (vmat2) function. vmat2 is a target for the development of treatments for methamphetamine abuse. structural modification of lobeline affords the defunctionalized analogues meso-transdiene (mtd) and lobelane, which have high potency and selectivity for vmat2. to establish the structure-activity relationships within this novel class of vmat2 ligands, specific stereochemical forms of mtd, lobelane, and other structurally related analogues have been synthesized. these compounds have been evaluated for inhibition of [(3)h]nicotine ([(3)h]nic) binding (alpha4beta2 nachr), [(3)h]methyllycaconitine ([(3)h]mla) binding (alpha7 nachr), and [(3)h]dihydrotetrabenazine ([(3)h]dtbz) binding (vmat2). generally, all of these analogues had lower affinities at alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nachrs compared to lobeline, thereby increasing selectivity for vmat2. the following structural modifications resulted in only modest changes in affinity for vmat2, affording analogues that were less potent than the lead compound, lobelane: (1) altering the stereochemistry at the c-2 and c-6 positions of the piperidino ring, (2) varying unsaturation in the piperidino c-2 and c-6 substituents, (3) introducing unsaturation into the piperidine ring, (4) ring-opening or eliminating the piperidine ring, and (5) removing the piperidino n-methyl group. furthermore, incorporating a quaternary ammonium group into defunctionalized lobeline molecules in the cis-series resulted in significant loss of affinity for vmat2, whereas only a modest change in affinity was obtained in the trans-series. the most potent (k(i) = 630 nm) and vmat2-selective compound evaluated was the n-methyl-2,6-cis-bis(naphthaleneethyl)piperidine analogue (1-nap-lobelane), in which the phenyl groups of lobelane were replaced with 1-naphthyl moieties. thus, initial structure-activity relationship studies reveal that the most promising structural changes to the lobeline molecule that lead to enhancement of vmat2 affinity and selectivity are defunctionalization, affording lobelane and mtd, and replacement of the phenyl rings of lobelane with other aromatic moieties that have a pi-extended structure.","zheng g, dwoskin lp, deaciuc ag, norrholm sd, crooks pa.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1140262,10.1021/jm0501228,,5551,17,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,5560,,16107155,,1.0,defunctionalized lobeline analogues: structure-activity of novel ligands for the vesicular monoamine transporter.,48,2005.0,fbcd66965a11dda4c4e961e109fc1d06062a19e60db1d8fdc61242671ac27f41,5888bc2e4943847f4d152c09dc8278cf0ee6f6f6694a48aaf416f0f70d6fff75,12,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"a major problem with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) is the delayed onset of action. a reason for that may be that the initial ssri-induced increase in serotonin levels activates somatodendritic 5-ht(1a) autoreceptors, causing a decrease in serotonin release in major forebrain areas. it has been suggested that compounds combining inhibition of the serotonin transport protein with antagonistic effects on the 5-ht(1a) receptor will shorten the onset time. the anxiolytic drug buspirone is known as 5-ht(1a) partial agonist. in the present work, we are studying the inhibition of the serotonin transporter protein by a series of buspirone analogues by molecular modelling and by experimental affinity measurements. models of the transporter protein were constructed using the crystal structure of the escherichia coli major facilitator family transporter-lacy and the x-ray structure of the neurotransmitter symporter family (nss) transporter-leut(aa) as templates. the buspirone analogues were docked into both sert models and the interactions with amino acids within the protein were analyzed. two putative binding sites were identified on the leut(aa) based model, one suggested to be a high-affinity site, and the other suggested to be a low-affinity binding site. molecular dynamic simulations of the lacy based model in complex with ligands did not induce a helical architecture of the lacy based model into an arrangement more similar to that of the leut(aa) based model.","jarończyk m, chilmonczyk z, mazurek ap, nowak g, ravna aw, kristiansen k, sylte i.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_2|creation_date:2009-11-30,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1142451,10.1016/j.bmc.2008.09.005,,9283,20,bioorg med chem,bioorganic & medicinal chemistry.,9294,,18812261,,1.0,the molecular interactions of buspirone analogues with the serotonin transporter.,16,2008.0,80ac8d981cb3f09fe144c1b008b2679b180069dc130e9508679173921552a825,f14bbc15fe3091b832aae9b25a90bfb2e48e7aab6df48f9d8020793a05f978a0,642,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"a new series of pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidines bearing various substituents at both the n5-pyrimidinyl and n8-pyrazolyl positions have been synthesized, and their binding affinities at the four human adenosine receptor subtypes (ha(1), ha(2a), ha(2b), and ha(3)) have been evaluated. all the described compounds contain arylacetyl moieties at the n5 position and arylalkyl substituents at the n8 position. surprisingly, all the compounds present their most potent affinities at the ha(2b) adenosine receptor with a range of selectivities against the other subtypes. when bulky groups are present simultaneously at the n5 and n8 positions (e.g., compound 9), the best selectivity for the ha(2b) receptor was observed (k(i)(ha(1)) = 1100 nm; k(i)(ha(2a)) = 800 nm; k(i)(ha(2b)) = 20 nm; k(i)(ha(3)) = 300 nm, k(i)(ha(1)/a(2b)) = 55, k(i)(ha(2a)/a(2b)) = 40, k(i)(ha(3)/ha(2b)) = 15). to understand the molecular significance of these results, we compared the putative tm (transmembrane) binding motif of compound 9 on both ha(2b) and ha(3) receptors. from our docking studies, compound 9 fits neatly inside the tm region of the ha(2b) receptor but not in the corresponding ha(3) region, illustrating significant differences between the two subtypes. the study herein presented permits an understanding of why the bioisosteric replacement of an -nh, present in previously reported ha(3) receptor antagonists, with a -ch(2) group at the n5 position induces such large differences in ha(2b)/ha(3) affinity. in the molecular structure of the ha(3) receptor, two residues, ser243 (tm6) and ser271 (tm7), create a hydrophilic region, which seems to permit a better accommodation of the phenylurea series into this putative ha(3) binding site than the phenylacetyl series.","pastorin g, da ros t, spalluto g, deflorian f, moro s, cacciari b, baraldi pg, gessi s, varani k, borea pa.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1145112,10.1021/jm030852k,,4287,20,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,4296,,13678407,,1.0,"pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine derivatives as adenosine receptor antagonists. influence of the n5 substituent on the affinity at the human a 3 and a 2b adenosine receptor subtypes: a molecular modeling investigation.",46,2003.0,9fd46b1e8c59f6dfdf0f0fd220d3c81bfc5b3022cd17f0850e0bc715570cd91f,0716407f3a727b225b552168973ab5d40d208a4ab66a81ccd115af571e6e95f0,891,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"3-fluoromethyl-7-(n-substituted aminosulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines (14, 16, and 18-22) are highly potent and selective inhibitors of phenylethanolamine n-methyltransferase (pnmt). molecular modeling studies with 3-fluoromethyl-7-(n-alkyl aminosulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines, such as 16, suggested that the sulfonamide -nh- could form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of lys57. however, sar studies and analysis of the crystal structure of human pnmt (hpnmt) in complex with 7 indicated that the sulfonamide oxygens, and not the sulfonamide -nh-, formed favorable interactions with the enzyme. thus, we hypothesized that replacement of the sulfonamide -nh- with a methylene group could result in compounds that would retain potency at pnmt and that would have increased lipophilicity, thus increasing the likelihood they will cross the blood brain barrier. a series of 3-fluoromethyl-7-sulfonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines (23-30) were synthesized and evaluated for their pnmt inhibitory potency and affinity for the alpha2-adrenoceptor. a comparison of these compounds with their isosteric sulfonamides (14, 16, and 18-22) showed that the sulfones were more lipophilic but less potent than their corresponding sulfonamides. sulfone 24 (hpnmt ki = 1.3 microm) is the most potent compound in this series and is quite selective for pnmt versus the alpha2-adrenoceptor, but 24 is less potent than the corresponding sulfonamide, 16 (hpnmt ki = 0.13 microm). we also report the crystal structure of hpnmt in complex with sulfonamide 15, from which a potential hydrogen bond acceptor within the hpnmt active site has been identified, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of asn39. the interaction of this residue with the sulfonamide -nh- is likely responsible for much of the enhanced inhibitory potency of the sulfonamides versus the sulfones.","grunewald gl, seim mr, regier rc, martin jl, gee cl, drinkwater n, criscione kr.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_1|creation_date:2009-09-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1149484,10.1021/jm060466d,,5424,18,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,5433,,16942016,,1.0,"comparison of the binding of 3-fluoromethyl-7-sulfonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines with their isosteric sulfonamides to the active site of phenylethanolamine n-methyltransferase.",49,2006.0,13c621f397fd66054b2f3f5b8ff608d76eb3bb5b93452c934d504889e044018b,112a8fa17f9d84eb8d89f36d044400634133a164db14e76c9b70257315bf3827,205,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"5'-methylthioadenosine/s-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (mtan) is a dual substrate bacterial enzyme involved in s-adenosylmethionine (sam) related quorum sensing pathways that regulates virulence in many bacterial species. mtans from many bacteria are directly involved in the quorum sensing mechanism by regulating the synthesis of autoinducer molecules that are used by bacterial communities to communicate. in humans, 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (mtap) is involved in polyamine biosynthesis as well as in purine and sam salvage pathways and thus has been identified as an anticancer target. previously we have described the synthesis and biological activity of several aza-c-nucleoside mimics with a sulfur atom at the 5' position that are potent e. coli mtan and human mtap inhibitors. because of the possibility that the sulfur may affect bioavailability, we were interested in synthesizing ""sulfur-free"" analogues. herein we describe the preparation of a series of ""sulfur-free"" transition state analogue inhibitors of e. coli mtan and human mtap that have low nano- to picomolar dissociation constants and are potentially novel bacterial anti-infective and anticancer drug candidates.","longshaw ai, adanitsch f, gutierrez ja, evans gb, tyler pc, schramm vl.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_10|creation_date:2011-05-26,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1240514,10.1021/jm100898v,,6730,18,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,6746,,20718423,,1.0,"design and synthesis of potent ""sulfur-free"" transition state analogue inhibitors of 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase and 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase.",53,2010.0,190449fd9c3a28efb65a4608848bfbd71c51664aa17dabb2fa7204c53249516d,6f3dfa6a0f0a67e0f2977494b6d6ca060a4983eaa454bc80244ca17abf22c310,266,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxy-4'-ethynylthymidine (4'-ed4t), a derivative of stavudine (d4t), has potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus and is much less inhibitory to mitochondrial dna synthesis and cell growth than its progenitor, d4t. 4'-ed4t triphosphate was a better reverse transcriptase (rt) inhibitor than d4t triphosphate, due to the additional binding of the 4'-ethynyl group at a presumed hydrophobic pocket in the rt active site. previous in vitro selection for 4'-ed4t-resistant viral strains revealed m184v and p119s/t165a/m184v mutations on days 26 and 81, respectively; m184v and p119s/t165a/m184v conferred 3- and 130-fold resistance to 4'-ed4t, respectively. we investigated the relative contributions of these mutations, engineered into the strain nl4-3 background, to drug resistance, rt activity, and viral growth. viral variants with single rt mutations (p119s or t165a) did not show resistance to 4'-ed4t; however, m184v and p119s/t165a/m184v conferred three- and fivefold resistance, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type virus. the p119s/m184v and t165a/m184v variants showed about fourfold resistance to 4'-ed4t. the differences in the growth kinetics of the variants were not more than threefold. the purified rt of mutants with the p119s/m184v and t165a/m184v mutations were inhibited by 4'-ed4ttp with 8- to 13-fold less efficiency than wild-type rt. m184v may be the primary resistance-associated mutation of 4'-ed4t, and p119s and t165a are secondary mutations. on the basis of our findings and the results of structural modeling, a virus with a high degree of resistance to 4'-ed4t (e.g., more than 50-fold resistance) will be difficult to develop. the previously observed 130-fold resistance of the virus with p119s/t165a/m184v to 4'-ed4t may be partly due to mutations both in the rt sequence and outside the rt sequence.","yang g, paintsil e, dutschman ge, grill sp, wang cj, wang j, tanaka h, hamasaki t, baba m, cheng yc.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_11|creation_date:2011-08-01,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL1649255,10.1128/aac.00686-09,,4640,11,antimicrob agents chemother,antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy.,4646,,19704131,,1.0,impact of novel human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase mutations p119s and t165a on 4'-ethynylthymidine analog resistance profile.,53,2009.0,7c479c651a377b98876950cc1164686155cc032714dd796f9e02e820d55bd693,8b999b5e998635ae85ccb7c1953031b0c4d8b2ebed2ba401b63c915d026dd8cd,115,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"5-(3-tosylureido)pyridine-2-sulfonamide and 4-tosylureido-benzenesulfonamide (ts-sa) only differ by the substitution of a ch by a nitrogen atom, but they have very different inhibitory properties against the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (ca, ec 4.2.1.1). by means of x-ray crystallography on the human ca ii adducts of the two compounds these differences have been rationalized. as all sulfonamides, the two compounds bind in deprotonated form to the zn(ii) ion from the enzyme active site and their organic scaffolds extend throughout the cavity, participating in many interactions with amino acid residues and water molecules. however the pyridine derivative undergoes a tilt of the heterocyclic ring compared to the benzene analog, which leads to a very different orientation of the two scaffolds when bound to the enzyme. this tilt also leads to a clash between a carbon atom from the pyridine ring of the first inhibitor and the oh moiety of thr200, leading to less effective inhibitory properties of the pyridine versus the benzene sulfonamide derivative. indeed, ts-sa is a promiscuous, low nanomolar inhibitor of 7 out of 10 human (h) ca isoforms, whereas the pyridine sulfonamide is a low nanomolar inhibitor only of the tumor-associated hca ix and xii, being less effective against other 9 isoforms. thus, a difference of one atom (n vs ch) in two isostructural sulfonamides leads to drastic differences of activity, phenomenon understood at the atomic level through the high resolution crystallographic structure and kinetic measurements reported in the paper. combining the tail and the ring approaches in the same chemotype leads to isoform-selective, highly effective sulfonamide ca inhibitors.","bozdag m, ferraroni m, nuti e, vullo d, rossello a, carta f, scozzafava a, supuran ct.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_19|creation_date:2014-07-03,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL3098114,10.1016/j.bmc.2013.11.016,,334,1,bioorg med chem,bioorganic & medicinal chemistry.,340,,24300919,,1.0,combining the tail and the ring approaches for obtaining potent and isoform-selective carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: solution and x-ray crystallographic studies.,22,2014.0,7dcf54601c7eb4d017af6c4780b6339d4f47cfe1ecee794bdb237e8cbe92da1c,76e39a658bebaa710689924916978076fb8ce8f5c2a7bd469f62295ea286394e,268,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"a major hurdle in permanently eliminating hiv from the body is the persistence of viral reservoirs, including those of the brain. one potential strategy towards eradicating hiv reservoirs of the brain is to block efflux transporters, such as p-glycoprotein (p-gp), that contribute to the limited penetration of antiviral agents across the blood-brain barrier (bbb). herein, we described a series of dimeric inhibitors of p-gp based on the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and p-gp substrate, abacavir. varying tether lengths were used to generate abacavir dimers to probe tether requirements for inhibitory potency. these dimeric agents were evaluated in two cell lines that express p-gp at varying levels: a p-gp over-expressing cd4(+) t-lymphocyte cell line (12d7-mdr) and a human brain capillary endothelial cell line as an in vitro model of the bbb (hcmec/d3) that expresses endogenous levels of p-gp. all dimeric abacavir analogs were inhibitors of p-gp efflux in the two cell lines with potencies that varied with tether length; the most potent agents displayed low micromolar inhibition. p-gp inhibition in a highly p-gp over-expressing cell line (mcf-7/dx1) was also observed with a range of therapeutic substrates. competition studies with the photoaffinity substrate [(125)i]iodoarylazidoprazosin demonstrated that abacavir dimers act by competing for the substrate binding sites of p-gp. these data demonstrate that the tether length of dimeric abacavir derivatives has a significant effect on inhibition of p-gp drug efflux, with up to a 35-fold increase in potency observed with longer tether linkages.","namanja ha, emmert d, hrycyna ca, chmielewski j.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_20|creation_date:2015-01-14,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL3217676,10.1039/c3md00196b,,1344,10,medchemcomm,,1349,,24273637,,1.0,homodimers of the antiviral abacavir as modulators of p-glycoprotein transport in cell culture: probing tether length.,4,2013.0,246ed0282c8687a47f9e93d2df99561b5146c32ef59b48a2898d5d78be563574,3c3ba92880c1dbc4cd24a3099d531417e305c7772ca36e8979251ac6ccd933b2,647,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"a new series of novel opioid ligands have been designed and synthesized based on the 4-anilidopiperidine scaffold containing a 5-substituted tetrahydronaphthalen-2yl)methyl group with different n-phenyl-n-(piperidin-4-yl)propionamide derivatives to study the biological effects of these substituents on μ and δ opioid receptor interactions. recently our group reported novel 4-anilidopiperidine analogues, in which several aromatic ring-contained amino acids were conjugated with n-phenyl-n-(piperidin-4-yl)propionamide and examined their biological activities at the μ and δ opioid receptors. in continuation of our efforts in these novel 4-anilidopiperidine analogues, we took a peptidomimetic approach in the present design, in which we substituted aromatic amino acids with tetrahydronaphthalen-2yl methyl moiety with amino, amide and hydroxyl substitutions at the 5th position. in in vitro assays these ligands, showed very good binding affinity and highly selective toward the μ opioid receptor. among these, the lead ligand 20 showed excellent binding affinity (2 nm) and 5000 fold selectivity toward the μ opioid receptor, as well as functional selectivity in gpi assays (55.20 ± 4.30 nm) and weak or no agonist activities in mvd assays. based on the in vitro bioassay results the lead compound 20 was chosen for in vivo assessment for efficacy in naïve rats after intrathecal administration. compound 20 was not significantly effective in alleviating acute pain. this discrepancy between high in vitro binding affinity, moderate in vitro activity, and low in vivo activity may reflect differences in pharmacodynamics (i.e., engaging signaling pathways) or pharmacokinetics (i.e., metabolic stability). in sum, our data suggest that further optimization of this compound 20 is required to enhance in vivo activity.","deekonda s, wugalter l, kulkarni v, rankin d, largent-milnes tm, davis p, bassirirad nm, lai j, vanderah tw, porreca f, hruby vj.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_22|creation_date:2016-11-08,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL3611974,10.1016/j.bmc.2015.07.071,,6185,18,bioorg med chem,bioorganic & medicinal chemistry.,6194,,26299827,,1.0,discovery of 5-substituted tetrahydronaphthalen-2yl-methyl with n-phenyl-n-(piperidin-4-yl)propionamide derivatives as potent opioid receptor ligands.,23,2015.0,3a1f7a5e633684ae539f51c08620d948763c48cdb1d18c386f981bd8d18f6aa5,6c168253696ea762d9a3e22aec0ac9aa4273fbe24efdbb5211221abb52e1c785,887,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (17β-hsd3) is a major player in human endocrinology, being one of the most important enzymes involved in testosterone production. to capitalize on the discovery of rm-532-105, a steroidal 17β-hsd3 inhibitor, we explored the effect of its backbone configuration on inhibitory activity, androgenic profile, and metabolic stability. two modifications that greatly alter the natural shape of steroids, i.e. inversion of the methyl on carbon 13 (13α-ch3 instead of 13β-ch3) and inversion of the hydrogen on carbon 5 (5β-h instead of 5α-h), were tested after the syntheses in 6 steps of 2 isomeric forms (5α/13α-rm-532-105 (6a) and 5β/13β-rm-532-105 (6b), respectively) of the 17β-hsd3 inhibitor rm-532-105 (5α/13β-configurations). for compound 6b, a cis/trans junction of the a/b rings did not significantly alter the inhibitory activity on 17β-hsd3 (ic50=0.15μm) as well as the liver microsomal stability (16.6% of 6b remaining after 1h incubation) compared to rm-532-105 (ic50=0.11μm and 14.1% remaining). in contrast, a trans/cis junction of c/d rings reduced the inhibitory activity on 17β-hsd3 (ic50=1.09μm) but increased the metabolic stability with 29.4% of compound 6a remaining after incubation. the structural modifications represented by compounds 6a and 6b did not change the non-androgenicity profile of an androsterone derivative such as rm-532-105, but slightly increased its cytotoxic activity.","cortés-benítez f, roy j, maltais r, poirier d.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_25|creation_date:2018-12-10,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL4004871,10.1016/j.bmc.2017.02.008,,2065,7,bioorg med chem,bioorganic & medicinal chemistry.,2073,,28254377,,1.0,"impact of androstane a- and d-ring inversion on 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 inhibitory activity, androgenic effect and metabolic stability.",25,2017.0,47599e2f6198d4d843b674a08cdfa7c710916e8bc09b2e8ab4e8ef2555fd0ae2,e6e7dd9274fa37abd1aedef72015cdb329d2e43c7784b73f130399ea4cb1e896,118,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"a new strategy in the design of aminergic gpcr ligands is proposed - the use of aromatic, heterocyclic basic moieties in place of the evergreen piperazine or alicyclic and aliphatic amines. this hypothesis has been tested using a benchmark series of 5-ht<sub>6</sub>r antagonists obtained by coupling variously substituted 2-aminoimidazole moieties to the well established 1-benzenesulfonyl-1h-indoles, which served as the ligands cores. the crystallographic studies revealed that upon protonation, the 2-aminoimidazole fragment triggers a resonance driven conformational change leading to a form of higher affinity. this molecular switch may be responsible for the observed differences in 5-ht<sub>6</sub>r activity of the studied chemotypes with different amine-like fragments. considering the multiple functionalization sites of the embedded guanidine fragment, diverse libraries were constructed, and the relationships between the structure and activity, metabolic stability, and solubility were established. compounds from the n-(1h-imidazol-2-yl)acylamide chemotype (10a-z) exhibited high affinity for 5-ht<sub>6</sub>r and very high selectivity over 5-ht<sub>1a</sub>, 5-ht<sub>2a</sub>, 5-ht<sub>7</sub> and d<sub>2</sub> receptors (negligible binding), which was attributed to their very weak basicity. the lead compound in the series 4-methyl-5-[1-(naphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1h-indol-3-yl]-1h-imidazol-2-amine (9i) was shown to reverse the cognitive impairment caused by the administration of scopolamine in rats indicating procognitive potential.","hogendorf as, hogendorf a, kurczab r, kalinowska-tłuścik j, popik p, nikiforuk a, krawczyk m, satała g, lenda t, knutelska j, bugno r, staroń j, pietruś w, matłoka m, dubiel k, moszczyński-pętkowski r, pieczykolan j, wieczorek m, pilarski b, zajdel p, bojarski aj.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_28|creation_date:2021-01-15,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL4351001,10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.06.001,,1,,eur j med chem,european journal of medicinal chemistry.,15,,31229883,,1.0,2-aminoimidazole-based antagonists of the 5-ht<sub>6</sub> receptor - a new concept in aminergic gpcr ligand design.,179,2019.0,38493e44ba0bed840a30d9fa3b69db8f6b4772cb117d6e99123145fcb8b34f67,fa8ec63c01aba34fa47f7d240a68e738e8fbfb24cc6e3f82ace6174d05a3cb6c,928,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"(nrh):quinone oxidoreductase 2 (nqo2) is associated with various processes involved in cancer initiation and progression probably via the production of ros during quinone metabolism. thus, there is a need to develop inhibitors of nqo2 that are active in vitro and in vivo. as part of a strategy to achieve this we have used the 4-aminoquinoline backbone as a starting point and synthesized 21 novel analogues. the syntheses utilised p-anisidine with meldrum's acid and trimethyl orthoacetate or trimethyl orthobenzoate to give the 4-hydrazin-quinoline scaffold, which was derivatised with aldehydes or acid chlorides to give hydrazone or hydrazide analogues, respectively. the hydrazones were the most potent inhibitors of nqo2 in cell free systems, some with low nano-molar ic<sub>50</sub> values. structure-activity analysis highlighted the importance of a small substituent at the 2-position of the 4-aminoquinoline ring, to reduce steric hindrance and improve engagement of the scaffold within the nqo2 active site. cytotoxicity and nqo2-inhibitory activity in vitro was evaluated using ovarian cancer skov-3 and tov-112 cells (expressing high and low levels of nqo2, respectively). generally, the hydrazones were more toxic than hydrazide analogues and further, toxicity is unrelated to cellular nqo2 activity. pharmacological inhibition of nqo2 in cells was measured using the toxicity of cb1954 as a surrogate end-point. both the hydrazone and hydrazide derivatives are functionally active as inhibitors of nqo2 in the cells, but at different inhibitory potency levels. in particular, 4-((2-(6-methoxy-2-methylquinolin-4-yl)hydrazono)methyl)phenol has the greatest potency of any compound yet evaluated (53 nm), which is 50-fold lower than its toxicity ic<sub>50</sub>. this compound and some of its analogues could serve as useful pharmacological probes to determine the functional role of nqo2 in cancer development and response to therapy.","hussein b, ikhmais b, kadirvel m, magwaza rn, halbert g, bryce ra, stratford ij, freeman s.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_28|creation_date:2021-01-15,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL4359921,10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.111649,,111649,,eur j med chem,european journal of medicinal chemistry.,111649,,31514018,,1.0,discovery of potent 4-aminoquinoline hydrazone inhibitors of nrh:quinoneoxidoreductase-2 (nqo2).,182,2019.0,ca693c5e5d5e6be007fc15b7f075d59db3248530b42ed0ade9229cf7ff134127,866e6a163d00ecd6aaa331f66a0e12d1d0c3834debb3b09585930d5fee3a0971,48,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00

"<i>n</i>-acylethanolamine acid amidase (naaa) is an n-terminal cysteine hydrolase primarily found in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment of innate and adaptive immune cells. naaa catalyzes the hydrolytic deactivation of palmitoylethanolamide (pea), a lipid-derived peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (ppar-α) agonist that exerts profound anti-inflammatory effects in animal models. emerging evidence points to naaa-regulated pea signaling at ppar-α as a critical control point for the induction and the resolution of inflammation and to naaa itself as a target for anti-inflammatory medicines. the present perspective discusses three key aspects of this hypothesis: the role of naaa in controlling the signaling activity of pea; the structural bases for naaa function and inhibition by covalent and noncovalent agents; and finally, the potential value of naaa-targeting drugs in the treatment of human inflammatory disorders.","piomelli d, scalvini l, fotio y, lodola a, spadoni g, tarzia g, mor m.",chembl_release:CHEMBL_29|creation_date:2021-07-01,,PUBLICATION,CHEMBL4610086,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00191,,7475,14,j med chem,journal of medicinal chemistry.,7490,,32191459,,1.0,"<i>n</i>-acylethanolamine acid amidase (naaa): structure, function, and inhibition.",63,2020.0,12d481393ddd1ccfe339d85eb0bb2ce24536134bbf9e2de89310d052650b90b6,0e8bbf679b00f709639843bf8630e049eaef289af022256c8a99ded214483323,348,ChEMBL_36,2025-12-06T12:45:42.946915+00:00
